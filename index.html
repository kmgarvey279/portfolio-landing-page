              <h4>Background</h4>
              <p>I was born in New Jersey, but I moved across the country to Southern Californita when I was about three
              years old. After completing two years at my local community college, I transfered to UC Santa Cruz where I
              where I obtained an undergraduate degree in Cultural Anthropology. I moved to Washington around three years
              ago and currently live in Seattle with my partner Kinley and our dog Asha.</p>
              <h4>Programming Experience</h4>
              <p>I am currently enrolled in a six month programming bootcamp at <em>Epicodus</em> where I intend to learn and refine
              the skills necessary to begin working in the field as soon as I graduate. I chose to enroll because I was
              unsatisfied with the job opportunities currently available and wanted to persue a more challenging career path where
              I could continuously hone my skills. Some of the projects that I have created while enrolled are available below. My
              prior experence with programing has primarily involved working through online courses and books and talking with
              numerous friends who have persued careers in programming.</p>
              <h4>More About Me</h4>
              <p>In my free time, I like to spend time with my partner and dog, read both fiction (I particularly enjoy mind-bending
              Philip K. Dick inspired sci-fi and stories with metafiction elements) and nonfiction (typically things that roughly fall
              into the buckets of history and/or philosophy), play video games(especially the <em>Dark Souls</em> series), and to draw.
              I also like to go camping in the summer.</p>
