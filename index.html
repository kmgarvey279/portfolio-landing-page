    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>I was born in New Jersey, but I moved across the country to Southern Californita when I was about three
    years old. After completing two years at my local community college, I transfered to UC Santa Cruz where I
    where I obtained an undergraduate degree in Cultural Anthropology. I moved to Washington around three years ago and currently
    live in Seattle with my partner Kinley and our dog Asha.</p>

    <h4>Programming Experience</h4>
    <p>I am currently enrolled in a six month programming bootcamp at Epicodus where I intend to learn and refine
    the skills necessary to begin working in the field as soon as I graduate. I chose to enroll because I was unsatisfied with the job opportunities
    currently available and wanted to persue a more challenging career path where I could continuously hone my skills. Some of the projects
    that I have created while enrolled are available below. My prior experence with programing has primarily involved working through online courses
    and books and talking with numerous friends who have persued careers in programming.</p>
    <h4>More About Me</h4>
    <p>In my free time, I like to walk and play with my dog, read both fiction (I particuarly enjoy crazy Philip K. Dick inspired sci-fi and stories
    with metafiction elements) and nonfiction (typically things that roughly fall into the buckets of history and/or philosophy), play video games
    (especially the Dark Souls series), and draw.
